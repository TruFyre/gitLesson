    <p>The pork walked down until he saw a for in the road. He then contemplated the pie in his pocket...thinking that all was well he used a well defined spork to eat it.
    Halfway through he pulled the cork from a bottle of wine for some refreshment.  He continues walking to York and stopped to help a man on the side of the road with a torque problem.</p>
